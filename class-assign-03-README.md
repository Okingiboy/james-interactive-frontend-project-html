WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
Identified non- semantic HTML elements that need be updated
Generally the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
The icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes
The heading attributes fall in sequential order
The title element have a concise, descriptive title
